 abstract = {Identification of larval mesoplankton is essential to the study of the supply-side ecology of marine benthic or sessile organisms, such as barnacles. Combined morphological and molecular identifications of wild-caught barnacle cyprids from Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR), Malaysia were studied based on mitochondrial 12S-rRNA gene sequences of the unidentified larvae and identified adults. Six species of barnacle adults and cyprids had matched DNA sequences. These included \textitFistulobalanus pattellaris, \textitFistulobalanus sp., \textitAmphibalanus reticulatus, \textitAmphibalanus variegatus, \textitAmphibalanus amphitrite, and \textitEuraphia withersi. Morphological characters of the identified cyprids were described, and used to develop a morphology-based classification tree. Carapace sculpturing pattern on the cyprids was the most important morphological discriminator. Preliminary  analysis  of  the  diversity  of  barnacle cyprids in MMFR showed that the dominant species could be morphologically classified with high accuracy.},
