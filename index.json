I aim to show that life sciences are highly relatable and touch on fundamental questions related to our own existence and daily life. I also connect life sciences to other disciplines, so students from different majors can see how these ideas connect with their fields.\nHere are some of the topics I will cover:\nEvolution by natural selection is a big idea. Where did it come from? Influences on Charles Darwin, including economic theories of resource competition. Why Charles Darwin\u0026rsquo;s theory of evolution is not just about \u0026ldquo;survival of the fittest\u0026rdquo;. Mutation can cause cancer, yet without it long term evolution is impossible. Survival of the luckiest: not all evolutionary changes are adaptations; some are simply the outcome of random sampling. Nature vs. Nurture: If evolution acts only on genes, does choice still matter? To fight or not to fight? Peace benefits everyone, but why it is so hard to maintain and why doesn\u0026rsquo;t aggression take over entirely in nature? If evolution acts on individual rather than group survival, how can cooperation and even self-sacrificial behavior evolve? Why have peacocks evolved a large, colorful tail that handicaps them? How sexual selection explains \u0026ldquo;illogical\u0026rdquo; mate choice in animals. Will the human population continue to grow? What limits it, and how does it compare to other organisms? Why do animal populations cycle or fluctuate? The link to the \u0026ldquo;the butterfly effect\u0026rdquo; If extinction is natural, why should we save species? If survival of the fittest rules nature, why save the losers? The race to resource exploitation: are we doomed, or can we escape \u0026ldquo;the tragedy of the commons\u0026rdquo;? Is reducing consumption the answer? How close are we to climate tipping points? Why didn\u0026rsquo;t we notice them coming earlier? Prerequisite None.

High-throughput techniques, such as co-fractionation coupled with mass spectrometry (CF-MS), have advanced protein complex studies by enabling global interactome inference. However, dealing with complex fractionation characteristics to define true interactions is not a simple task, since CF-MS is prone to false positives due to the co-elution of non-interacting proteins by chance. Several computational methods have been designed to analyze CF-MS data and construct probabilistic protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks. Current methods usually first infer PPIs based on handcrafted CF-MS features, and then use clustering algorithms to form potential protein complexes. While powerful, these methods suffer from the potential bias of handcrafted features and severely imbalanced data distribution. However, the handcrafted features based on domain knowledge might introduce bias, and current methods also tend to overfit due to the severely imbalanced PPI data. To address these issues, we present a balanced end-to-end learning architecture, Software for Prediction of Interactome with Feature-extraction Free Elution Data (SPIFFED), to integrate feature representation from raw CF-MS data and interactome prediction by convolutional neural network. SPIFFED outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in predicting PPIs under the conventional imbalanced training. When trained with balanced data, SPIFFED had greatly improved sensitivity for true PPIs. Moreover, the ensemble SPIFFED model provides different voting schemes to integrate predicted PPIs from multiple CF-MS data. Using the clustering software (i.e. ClusterONE), SPIFFED allows users to infer high-confidence protein complexes depending on the CF-MS experimental designs.

Short human eccDNAs from different datasets indeed have low similarity in genomic locations, but DeepCircle successfully learned shared DNA sequence features to make accurate cross-datasets predictions (accuracy: convolution-based models: 79.65 ± 4.7\\%, attention-based models: 83.31 ± 4.18\\%).The excellent performance of our models shows that the intrinsic predictability of eccDNAs is encoded in the sequences across tissue origins.

Similar to other plankton, these larval invertebrates often possess protruding body extensions, but their function beyond predator deterrence is not well-documented. For example, the planktonic nauplii of crustaceans have spines. Using the epibiotic pedunculate barnacle *Octolasmis* spp., we investigated how the dorsal thoracic spine affects swimming and fluid disturbance by comparing nauplii with their spines partially removed against those with intact spines. Our motion analysis showed that amputated *Octolasmis* spp. swam slower, in jerkier trajectories, and were less efficient per stroke cycle than those with intact spines. Amputees showed alterations in limb beat pattern: larger beat amplitude, increased phase lag, and reduced contralateral symmetry. These changes might partially help increase propulsive force generation and streamline the flow, but were insufficient to restore full function. Particle image velocimetry further showed that amputees had a larger relative area of influence, implying elevated risk by rheotactic predator. Body extensions and their interactions with limb motion play important biomechanical roles in shaping larval performance, which likely influences the evolution of form.","tags":null,"title":"A tail’s tale: biomechanical roles of dorsal thoracic spine of barnacle nauplii","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Jin Yung Wong**","Benny K.

For aquatic organisms, they can transition from viscosity- to inertia-dominated fluid regimes as they grow. Such transitions are often associated with changes in morphology, swimming speed and kinematics. Barnacles do not fit into this norm as they have two morphologically distinct planktonic larval phases that swim differently but are of comparable sizes and operate in the same fluid regime (Reynolds number 100–101). We quantified the hydrodynamics of the rocky intertidal stalked barnacle *Capitulum mitella* from the nauplius II to cyprid stage and examined how kinematics and size increases affect its swimming performance. Cyprids beat their appendages in a metachronal wave to swim faster, more smoothly, and with less backwards slip per beat cycle than did all naupliar stages. Micro-particle image velocimetry showed that cyprids generated trailing viscous vortex rings that pushed water backwards for propulsion, contrary to the nauplii's forward suction current for particle capture. Our observations highlight that zooplankton swimming performance can shift via morphological and kinematic modifications without a significant size increase. The divergence in ecological functions through ontogeny in barnacles and the removal of feeding requirement likely contributed to the evolution of the specialized, taxonomically unique cyprid phase.","tags":["nauplius","cyprid","high speed imaging","metamorphosis","flow structure"],"title":"Swimming kinematics and hydrodynamics of barnacle larvae throughout development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Jin Yung Wong**","Benny K.

For marine invertebrate larvae, appendage movement determines locomotion, feeding, and predator avoidance ability. Barnacle larvae are morphologically diverse, and the morphology of non-feeding lecithotrophic nauplii are distinct from those that are planktotrophic. Lecithotrophic larvae have a more globular body shape and simplified appendages when compared to planktotrophs. However, little is known about whether and how such morphological changes affect kinematics, hydrodynamics, and ecological functions. Here, we compared the nauplii kinematics and hydrodynamics of a lecithotrophic Rhizocephalan species, *Polyascus planus*, against that of the planktotrophic nauplii of an intertidal barnacle, *Tetraclita japonica*. High-speed, micro-Particle Image Velocimetry analysis showed that the *Polyascus* nauplii swam faster and had higher amplitude and more synchronous appendage beating than the *Tetraclita* nauplii. This fast swimming was accompanied by a faster attenuation of induced flow with distance, suggesting reduced predation risk. *Tetraclita* nauplii had more efficient per beat cycles with less backward displacement during the recovery stroke. This “anchoring effect” resulted from the anti-phase beating of appendages. This movement, together with a high-drag body form, likely helps direct the suction flow towards the ventral food capturing area. In sum, the tradeoff between swimming speed and predation risks may have been an important factor in the evolution of the observed larval forms.","tags":["Functional morphology","Cirripedia","PIV","tradeoff","kinematics","larvae"],"title":"Evolution of feeding shapes swimming kinematics of barnacle naupliar larvae: a comparison between trophic modes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Jin Yung Wong**","K.

Their morphology impose constraints on their ecological functions and reflect their evolutionary history. To explore the potential functional basis underlying the similarities and differences in barnacle larval form, we conducted a meta-analysis on the shape of the barnacle nauplii’s cephalic shield and examined its relation to larval size, trophic mode, pelagic larval duration and habitat. Nauplii cephalic shield morphology of 102 species were quantified with normalized elliptic Fourier analysis. Most of the species were distributed around the center of the morphospace but a few extreme groups occupied the periphery: nauplii that were large and lecithotrophic. Subsequent principal component regression analyses showed that larval size was a good predictor of the first shape variations axis (aspect ratio). After allometry adjustment, nauplii from different trophic modes differentiated along the second axis of the major shape variations (relative frontal horn length). Habitat was a poor predictor of variations in naupliar body form, but it could be used to differentiate extreme morphology groups from other nauplii. Our result suggests that size-related biomechanical or developmental constraints and feeding requirements are important in shaping the evolution of the naupliar body form. Within the limitations of these functional constraints, habitat drives the divergence of extreme morphology groups from the majority of species. Our comparative morphometrics analysis demonstrated how variations in larval body form can be quantitatively linked to the functional needs that constrain or drive their diversity, and inform further empirical experiments on larval functional morphology.","tags":["barnacle larvae","frontal horns","outline analysis","morphometrics","allometry","functional constraints","lecithotrophy","morphospace evolution"],"title":"Phylogenetic, ecological and biomechanical constraints on larval form: a comparative morphological analysis of barnacle nauplii","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Jin Yung Wong**","Cecilia Chu","Ving Ching Chong","Sarinder Kaur Dhillon","Kar Hoe Loh"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682138229,"objectID":"339fc010400b7f17db4af3acd5402503","permalink":"https://jinyung.github.io/publication/wong-2016-sciaenidotolith/","publishdate":"2020-06-29T14:41:54.195572Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wong-2016-sciaenidotolith/","section":"publication","summary":"Combined multiple 2D views (proximal, anterior and ventral aspects) of the sagittal otolith are proposed here as a method to capture shape information for fish classification.

Methods for the development of this automated classification system are discussed.","tags":["automated classification","geometric morphometrics","Malaysia","otoliths","shape analysis"],"title":"Automated otolith image classification with multiple views: an evaluation on Sciaenidae","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Jin Yung Wong**","Hsi-Nien Chen","Benny K.

Combined morphological and molecular identifications of wild-caught barnacle cyprids from Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR), Malaysia were studied based on mitochondrial 12S-rRNA gene sequences of the unidentified larvae and identified adults. Six species of barnacle adults and cyprids had matched DNA sequences. These included *Fistulobalanus pattellaris*, *Fistulobalanus* sp., *Amphibalanus reticulatus*, *Amphibalanus variegatus*, *Amphibalanus amphitrite*, and *Euraphia withersi*. Morphological characters of the identified cyprids were described, and used to develop a morphology-based classification tree. Carapace sculpturing pattern on the cyprids was the most important morphological discriminator. Preliminary analysis of the diversity of barnacle cyprids in MMFR showed that the dominant species could be morphologically classified with high accuracy.","tags":["larval ecology","barnacle cyprids","classification","DNA barcoding","mangrove"],"title":"A combined morphological and molecular approach in identifying barnacle cyprids from the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve in Malaysia: essentials for larval ecology studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Animals ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1767865363,"objectID":"665288c8761d48eb3366c37954243edc","permalink":"https://jinyung.github.io/gallery/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/gallery/","section":"","summary":"Animals ","tags":null,"title":"Gallery","type":"page"}]
